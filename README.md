#Route Generator

This project aims at generating full route tables for network lab purposes. All routes generated are null/blackhole routes and can be distributed via any dynamic routing protocol.

The base of this project is to spin up a Docker image with FRR and load a BGP route table but this project may also be expanded to other routing platforms such as but not limited to Mikrotik's RouterOS, VyOS, etc.
